H2rename by Harald Boegeholz (bo@ct.de) / c't Magazin, www.ct.de

H2rename is a batch renaming program for files and directories. It
DOES NOT support regular expressions. Its strength is recognizing
special characters like umlauts that have been broken by transfering
files between, e.g., Windows and Linux. In this case H2rename will
automatically suggest renaming rules to fix them.

This program served as an example in an article about Qt programming
published in c't 15/2009, p. 186.
